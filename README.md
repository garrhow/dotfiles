- Scripts in `~/.local/bin/`

## Usage

This repository includes a `Makefile` with commands for easing the use of these dotfiles.

- `make deploy`: Deploys dotfiles to user's home directory. This **will** overwrite your existing dotfiles, please back them up.

## Acknowledgements

These dotfiles were intended for use with the Arch Linux distribution and suckless programs such as:

- [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) (window manager)
- [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) (menu bar)
- [slstatus](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/) (status bar)
- [st](https://st.suckless.org/) (terminal emulator)

The scripts found in `~/.local/bin/` are POSIX-compliant and will work with most shells and sets of UNIX utilities, e.g., GNU coreutils, Plan 9, \*BSD, etc.
