## Usage

This repository includes a `Makefile` with commands for easing the use of these dotfiles.

- `make deploy`: Deploys dotfiles to user's home directory. This **will** overwrite pre-existing dotfiles, so please back them up.
- `make themes`: Deploys desktop themes and icons to the current user's home directory.

## Acknowledgements

These dotfiles were intended for use with a Unix-like operating system (Arch Linux, Gentoo, OpenBSD, etc.).

The scripts found in `~/.local/bin/` are POSIX-compliant and will work with most shells and sets of UNIX utilities, e.g., GNU coreutils, Plan 9, \*BSD, etc.
