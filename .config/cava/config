[output]

# Output method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses' or 'raw'.
# 'noncurses' uses a custom framebuffer technique and draws only changes
# from frame to frame. 'ncurses' is default if supported
#
# 'raw' is an 8 or 16 bit (configurable via the 'bit_format' option) data
# stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.
method = ncurses

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
# 'mono_option' set mono to either take input from 'left', 'right' or 'average'.

# Raw output target. A fifo will be created if target does not exist.

# Binary bit format, can be '8bit' (0-255) or '16bit' (0-65530).

# Ascii max value. In 'ascii' mode range will run from 0 to value specified here
; ascii_max_range = 1000

# Use decimal value in ascii table (i.e. 59 = ';' and 10 = '\n' (line feed)).

# Remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
